Been learning a lot of jQuery these past 2 weeks, and now to put it to the test. I am using MAMP for my development environment. I started noticing that with some more complicated JS/jQuery that simply opening a file was not looking the same online vs. on my local browser.

Anyway, let the fun begin.
